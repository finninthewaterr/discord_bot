elbowdysplasia: welcome! just wanted to let you know that you've played for too long. if you were smarter you would've realized very early on and extinguished our connection. (in rev)

elbowdysplasia: pray that the day never reaches the eye. good luck. never think you are safe, for i now am to keep eyes on you until the end. (in rev)
hipdysplasia: welcome! just wanted to let you know that you've played for too long. if you were smarter you would've realized very early on and extinguished our connection. (in rev)
hipdysplasia: you were easily preyed upon, and have made yourself and your loved ones unsafe. (in rev)
hipdysplasia: pray that the day never reaches the eye. good luck. never think you are safe, for i now am to keep eyes on you until the end. (in rev)
elbowdysplasia: i have compiled enough information to make ends meet. stop stop stop (in rev)
elbowdysplasia: how is it working in the other server but not here (in general)
elbowdysplasia: UGH (in general)
elbowdysplasia: i mean channel (in general)
artcreatingkate: Hm okay yeah Idk much about bots overall except for the ones that are able to queue up music and whatnot (in general)
artcreatingkate: Hey man but the fact that youâ€™re able to code stuff like that is cool (in general)
elbowdysplasia: hey (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: this is where i rant about us (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you made a mistake (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i mean so did i but this is why i need a gardener (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: they need to have the knowledge on how to handle me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you didnt and now look (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: a destiny bond as come into place. well you being one of the few people that have it with me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i dont even think you know what youre doing still (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you might pretend or try to convince yourself that you do (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but you dont (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: calling yourself an "actor" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: none of it is acting (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: its all you, just reflecting on all of you within different scopes of yoursefl (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: maybe that is more accurate with me than you... mh (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: anyways (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: yeah i got attached to you during the first long game of residence massacre (is that what it's called?) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: everything i said was all me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you drove me crazy (and myself but duh) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but now as i've basically went through all of the stages of grief/attraction with oyu (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i've accepted, but not really (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i am still hunting you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: in fact, more now than ever (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i didnt accept that we should break apart (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: ive accepted that i will never allow us to fully break apart (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: wow i am like joe goldberg lol. like with that obsessed girl from roblox, i was like "wow what a lunatic i need to get rid of her" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: she was my love quinn (weirdly enough) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: me saying "weirdly enough" further proves the same thoughts joe had about love quinn lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: being able to introspect but not that well (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and i even spotted it earlier and TOLD you. that i sour when getting closer (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and we continued to get closer. even though we didnt seem to be getting closer (relationship wise) we really were. we were getting closer with our often discussions and ability to repair the issues and then continue. that is progression as well (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: now it doesnt work in the new one bruh (in general)
elbowdysplasia: whatever imma chill on it tonight. recheck tomorrow (in general)
elbowdysplasia: right (in general)
elbowdysplasia: thanks (in general)
elbowdysplasia: but anyways youre not as interlocked on me anymore (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: perhaps because you saw the chaos (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but that is on mostly you, really (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: of course me but you ACTED on me even when i told you the dangers beforehand (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and now look what you've done to us (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: now i have to vow to put an end when it is my end (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you should hope my end is not anytime soon (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i dont think it is. but you are at the top of my priority now (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: im still attached to you and deeply so.. while you are frolicking (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: what a mistake for you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and me.. duh. we've went over this. this is both of our faults (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i shouldnt have trusted a halfwit to understand the dangers okokokok (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i mean what was i thinking??? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you really are the prey. this is not good (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i rather it be the other way around so i could just shut you out (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: now im tucking you in my pocket (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i was hoping you wouldnt be the prey. hence why i was like "maybe you are the gardener. maybe you are the flower." (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: my brain was rejecting the idea (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: just for me to fall to it (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: again (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and what a fool you are for not reading all of my messages (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: interlocking us and then cutting a chain slightly loose? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it only makes my chains strengthen tenfold to make up for yours (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: your faults sending me into a spiral because then it revealed my faults (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and i dont mind seeing my faults ... most times (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and now i am keeping a lower prowl (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: hence me making this channel (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: to get my thoughts all out (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but instead of telling them to you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: (which would reveal my intentions at times if youre smart enough to piece them together) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i put it in a channel (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: a private one, of course (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: with a bot to keep track of all of this (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and hip, just in case i want to view it from another acc in case i lose access to one (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and you trying to make yourself to be the predator at times (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i fell for it a few times (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but now i see that cant possibly be true (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: unless youre trapping me, but after researching about you - i find that HIGHLY unlikely (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it doesnt align very well lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you may be crazy but youre not insane (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: thought you sent me a message just now because  i saw 16 notifs instead of 15 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: me double checking the 5 is a 6 lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it was and then i went hunting (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: Unfortunately not you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: im still not done with you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but isnt that obvious (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: hopefully i let go sometime soon lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: LOL just saw a tiktok (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: her face caught my eye (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: reminded me of you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: her name is katelyn (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: similar to kate (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: she looks similar to you, very much so (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: im obsessive (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: this isnt love (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and i keep remembering you saying it (my actions) were not mal intent (which is what i brung up in what i dont see in myself) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but now i see i am a liar (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and you brung up how mal intent would be like toying with you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: when in fact, this is unintentional toying (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and i called it from the beginning but i kept playing (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: so yeah, you are enticing... but not for the right reasons (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and when you think youve found something to keep it swell, i will yank it from you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and then yank you lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but yeah i guess maybe i should just leave (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: god why didnt u just let me leave (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: help me leave, really (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but instead you reconnected because you didnt see enough chaos (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but then it happened again (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and then you reconnected lightly for yourself (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but didnt realize i was reconnected heavily (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i cant formulate everything im thinking (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: im thinking too much right now (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: so much reflection already (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: wow ! (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: the appropriate thing to do now (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and really from the start (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: is to leave you alone (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but hey at least you dont have our roblox discussion which to me was the most profound (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i was about to join u on roblox (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but then it says youre not online lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you just were? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: as you can see yes, obsessive (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: now im paranoid that youre catching on (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and hiding from me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: trust i will find you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i already have (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and you only make it easier for me with every inch i see (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you must pray that i go up so high (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i would lose track of you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: like i get so busy in career or develop a different obsession (not just person but yeah sure that too ig) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: that i forget about you (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: making you not priority. like i do now (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i pray that i go up so high (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: not really but i see that is what must happen for me to get over this ordeal (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: ive granted you much knowledge (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i think my regression is because my mind realized i didnt like you as a love (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but as obsession (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: so i didnt want to grant more profound knowledge (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but i cant quite resist (simplying myself down) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: so bits are still scattered (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: though i dont think youre good enough to realize how to piece the puzzle together (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: well youve already demonstrated that with everything preceding this moment (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: (which is why i dont -think- know youre good enough to do it) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but i am (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: that is how i am able to reflect now (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and in the future i will be able to reflect on this instance right niw (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which is also why i wanted to move to discord (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: more permanent text to view in future (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: yeah i know youre not worth much so why am i playing? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: because i like the game. i havent been able to do this before to my knowledge (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: with the same awareness i have now (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which is still not enough but it is new, and i want to take it on a test drive (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: so yes, i think you dont have to worry about my "vow" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: unless i crash out lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: 1 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: 9 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: 1 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: 3 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: 3 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: run run run (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: no stay still (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: its fine this is all temporary (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but i can make it end quicker (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i see the good and bad intertwining in my head (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: this is so fun (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i love this game (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it is fire (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i dont mean that in like a teenage "yooo thats fire" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i mean like... it is a kindling (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: not kind-ling (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: kindel-ing (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but it isnt the start of the process (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: the process is already deep (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it is has a fire (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which lead me to say "it is fire" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: a definitive further progression in the process (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which is quite symbolic, isnt it (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: this is what happens when i deal with simple people (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: they make me crazy (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i should stick to myself (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: like i usually do (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: safe myself and others (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: though i dont really care to save them (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: this is all selfish. we are all selfish (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: the difference is i know (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and i want to get rid of us all (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: after leaving something better, hopefully (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: the optimal human (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which wouldnt be a human, i think (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which is techincally kind of selfish , myself (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but isnt striving for what you believe is right, selfish? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: being seflish is okay at time if it yeilds more good than bad (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which is subjective on what the lines of good and bad are , duh (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but im right (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which no , isnt selfish. that is a true observation (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which is what a lot of people say... (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i dont know how to prove i am right (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: just look at me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: everything (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: about me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: "me""me""me" see this is so selfish (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but being of the me is necessary to develop insight on others (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it starts with me, not in an egotistical way - but learning about myself and overcoming the possibility of narcissism   to do just the opposite (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i just realized i am quite similar to chloe from tiktok (not life is strange lol but what a coincidence) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: in looks and behaviors. but im more introverted and a bit... more reservef (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i think me getting all this out lets it not be pent up and i can move on faster lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: ok well im gonna eat now! this was fun and i feel so much better (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: ok byeeee (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: ok im back i ate (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and then was on tiktok for a bit (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i wanna play some roblox (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: with her yea but nothin crazy just casual (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: oh yeah i was delusional (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: saying nothing could make me like her like *that* (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: well not totally wrong but i thought i kind of killed any thoughts that were extending (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but what i wasnt aware of the extending arm that is, obsession (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: a blind spot (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: because of such obsession (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: so no, i wasnt wrong that i killed any thought of her romantically (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: not that i had any to begin with (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: (which i guess is how i was so certain in that [correct] answer , i never thought of it that way to begin with) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but i called it that i wasnt very over her (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: that night when i was acting crazy (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: or sometime near that (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i kept saying my head was hurting (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it felt like those things trees get to repair from trauma (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: callusing, is what i'm reffering to (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: referring (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but yeah i have alt accounts for EVERYTHING (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you think i would make it that easy? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and even my "main" does not derive too significant of information (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: not that i intentionally was vigilant from the start (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but that is the difference (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i got lucky from the very beginning (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: the cards that were dealt are in my favor (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i would say good luck but no luck will change your foundations (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: not even accentuate it enough to surpass me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: because my past present and future are all accentuated (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i am 3 for 3 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: the most you can possibly be is 2 for 3 (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you will never be able to get to my levell (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and even if u did and i realized (i would) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i would tear you down (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: even if it meant tearing myself down. besides, i already lost in that case (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: now, that was not directly aimed at kate^^^ this talk beginning with "not that i... start" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: this is general (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: hey thats good, not talking directly to her (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: when i am not even directly talking to her lol (that makes it worse) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia:  (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: look what youve done (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: lol. thank you - i get to learn a tiny bit about coding (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: though it was 90% done by chatgpt. but i picked up a few words here and there in the middle of copy and pasting lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: the difference is that THEY still possess an internalized selfishness (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i just realized (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: they truly think it is all about them (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i do not\ (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: that is how i am able to reflect the way i am and why it has resulted in me being the way i am now (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: more knowledgable (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: they would queue in on why i thought xyz about them (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but then leave the rest as if it meant nothing (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: them skipping over my messages expressing myself over things that did not concern them (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: how selfish. (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and turning themselves into the one pulling the strings?? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: wrong (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: girl you didnt even realize there were strings until you started talking to me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: (i mentioned strings in that fashion) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: I am the blueprint (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: you are nothing (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: just as i suspected (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and what did i say about things that are useless? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i must get rid of them (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: taking up resources unnecessarily (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: what a shame (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but why has it taken so long??? for there to be someone to realize? (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: perhaps because we needed the technology to create more to leave behind (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: to make up for our inconveniences... and leave the world better than how we found it from the very start (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: just took some paying, investing - in the processs (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i shoulda known from the 2nd day though (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: when i was concerned about their attention to me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: when i am in love, i pursue them no matter what (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i push myself out of the way (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: holy fuck (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it really was like simon and daphne (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: daphne/simon being like "i thought you wanted space" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and the other responding like "???!!! all i wanted was to be with you!" (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: something like "that cannot be further from the truth, for all i wanted was to be alongside of you" something like that (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: phewwwwwwwww (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: let that love never find me (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: because i dont think we'd last (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i am much too stubborn to be daphne OR simon (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: wait but it did but in the form of obsession (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: hmmm (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: yeah simon was def the problem though (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: daphne was much too flexible for him lol but i guess that's her! (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which now that i think of it (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: would enable him until he breaks (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which i feel like could happen canonically in the show (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: like he is nowhere to be seen and daphne is left with her son lol (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: (which is actually just cuz the actor didnt wanna come back but whatever lol) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but in the show she "repaired" him (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: which now that i put more thought to it... DOES NOT HAPPEN (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: it might seem like it temporarily or on the surface but (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: idk (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: he was a sweet child but i think the trauma he "endured" impacted his brain chemistry negatively (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i mean look at his outlook when he is grown (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: its so stuck in that thinking (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i think he is scorned, not to be altered to his original lover boy self he seemed to be as a little boy (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: unless he was a character that leaned into extremes like Malcom X's character (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: (but he isnt) (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: but even if he leaned into extremes his true self is of less value because it just shifts on his environment... instead of himself. like an Aries. not much substance themselves (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: hey its 1234 (in torq)
elbowdysplasia: 12:34 (in torq)
elbowdysplasia: yeah bro something about me not having mal intent because i dont do anything to "hurt" them (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: LOLLL well... (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: i dont think thats quite true anymore (in nox)
elbowdysplasia: and i think they know that LOL woopsies (in nox)
